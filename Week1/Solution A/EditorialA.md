# Simple Substrings

All you need to do here is make a simple observation. You can make this observation by taking a few sample cases on your own.  
Every character apart from the first and last character get repeated . So you just have to print every alternating character from the start.  
The length of the given string will always be even, and since the loop prints only the characters at odd index (for 1 base indexing), you'll have to print the last character separately.
