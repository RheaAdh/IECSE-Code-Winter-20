# Rectangles

If the given n is odd the answer is 0, because the perimeter of any rectangle is always even number.

If n is even the number of rectangles which can be construct equals to n / 4. If n is divisible by 4 we will count the square, which are deprecated, because we need to subtract 1 from the answer.
